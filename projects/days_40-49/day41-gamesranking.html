<h1>My Top 3 Games</h1>
<h2>By Pedro Sergey</h2>
<p>
    This rank is not only based on the game itself, but also in the period of life that I played and what supposed to me. <br />
    Aditionally, there is not an specific order, they are just the three games that I had more present during my life.

<h3>Pokemon Yellow</h3>
<p>
    GBA was my first console, along with this fascinating game. <br />
    I do not know really how many hours did I play this game, but I am sure that was the start of my lovely relationship with this pasionate world. <br />
    I would like to highlight, that I got the diploma for completing the Pokedex :)!
</p>
<h3>Crash Bandicoot 3</h3>
<p>
The PS1 triloghy of Crash Bandicoot were my favourites in the transition to the PS. <br />
When the remasterized came to PS4, ofc I played them again (with platinium trophy included).
</p>
<h3>League of Legends</h3>
<p>
    Final mention to LOL, this game where I have spend thousand of hours playing. <br />
    I used to play it in a bad period of my life as a scape from the reality. <br />
    Now, after the years, I enjoy playing it, but with a completely different mindset.
